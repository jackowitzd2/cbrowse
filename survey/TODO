Urltable.py

	  - Looks like there can also be queries or params in other parts of the
	    URL... So have to do splitting within each section
	  - Perhaps allow a customizable "similarity threshold", meaning a number
	    of differences to tolerate before considreing something a separate URL
	    or could there be a way of determining this dynamically?
	    - Need to improve the similarity threshold; some URLs have a ton of params
	      that are different but are fundamentally the same but can't lower sim
	      threshold universally; perhaps weight different segments higher?
	    - For example, if all netloc segments and path same, URLs very likely 
	      should be considered similar
	  - There is additional splitting that should be done; examples:
	    - amazon.com, https://pixel.adsafeprotected.com... commas within query
	      javascript? param is called "jsinfo"
	    - At the same time, there are sometimes unique comma-separated lists of 
	      numbers as param values; necessarily want to split those
