"""
  This file contains the implementation of a different data structure for
  organizing URLs of resources required by a website.

  Rather than splitting URLs into a hierarchical data structure, URLs that
  are not sufficiently similar will be stored as unrelated entries, whereas
  URLs that meet some "similarity threshold" will be stored with some
  redundancy.

  The overall data structure for storing all inconsistent URLs in a page will
  be a list of dictionaries. The top level list will contain all the sets of 
  similar URLs.
  
  Each element of that list will be a dictionary representing a set
  of similar URLs. Each dictionary has keys representing each segment and
  as a value has a list of possible variations for the segment within a set
  of similar URLs.

  The keys are tuples of the form (Seg #, Seg text) where the number is nec-
  essary because a dictionary is unordered and we ultimately want to be able
  to reconstruct the original URL in some recognizable way, which means main-
  taining the original order of the segments. The seg text is the text of the
  segment if it has only one possible value among a set of similar URLs; which
  must be the case for a certain percent of segments in a set of URLs for them
  to be considered similar; this percent is specified as the "similarity thres-
  hold". If the segment text has only one possible variation in a list of similar
  URLs, the value will be an empty list.

  If the segment corresponds to a segment that varies across a set of similar
  URLs, the segment text will be set to a "wildcard symbol" and the possible
  variations of the segment text will be stored in the list corresponding to that
  key value pair.

  NB. Currently in the case of non-empty variation lists, the data structure just 
  lists all possible variations with no repetition, and therefore says nothing about
  the number of occurrences of each variation. TODO: this might be useful to add,
  (But considering the things that vary are often things like access ids, and they
  are always different, it might not be necessary.
